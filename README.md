# Mercury
An app to track your jogs.
This project uses React Native, Redux, SQLite3 and an SVG-Charting library to document jogging. 

## CURRENT MVP

### Records each jog
	Tracks geolocation
	Stores data on phone in SQLite3 database
	Redux stores state on a Jog and Interval basis
	Charting Library reveals how long and how far you've jogged
